# Keyframes Guide for anime.js

## Introduction

Keyframes in anime.js allow you to create complex, multi-step animations by defining specific states at different points in the animation timeline. This guide will walk you through how to use keyframes effectively in your anime.js animations.

## Defining Keyframes

In anime.js, keyframes are defined as an array of objects, where each object represents a specific state in the animation. Here's the basic structure:

```javascript
anime({
  targets: '.element',
  keyframes: [
    {property1: value1, property2: value2},
    {property1: value3, property2: value4},
    // ... more keyframes
  ]
});
```

Each object in the `keyframes` array represents a keyframe, and the properties within each object define the state of the animated properties at that keyframe.

## Controlling Keyframe Timing

By default, keyframes are distributed evenly across the animation duration. However, you can control the timing of individual keyframes using the `duration` property:

```javascript
anime({
  targets: '.element',
  keyframes: [
    {translateX: 250, opacity: 1, duration: 1000},
    {translateY: 50, opacity: 0.5, duration: 500},
    {translateX: 0, opacity: 1, duration: 1000}
  ],
  easing: 'easeOutElastic(1, .8)',
  loop: true
});
```

In this example, the first keyframe lasts for 1000ms, the second for 500ms, and the third for 1000ms.

## Using Percentage-Based Timing

For more precise control over keyframe timing, you can use percentage-based timing:

```javascript
anime({
  targets: '.element',
  keyframes: [
    {translateX: 250, opacity: 1, offset: '0%'},
    {translateY: 50, opacity: 0.5, offset: '30%'},
    {translateX: 0, opacity: 1, offset: '100%'}
  ],
  duration: 3000,
  easing: 'easeOutElastic(1, .8)',
  loop: true
});
```

The `offset` property defines when each keyframe should occur as a percentage of the total animation duration.

## Combining Keyframes with Other Properties

You can combine keyframes with other anime.js properties for more complex animations:

```javascript
anime({
  targets: '.element',
  translateX: 250,
  rotate: '1turn',
  backgroundColor: '#FFF',
  duration: 3000,
  keyframes: [
    {scale: 0.8, borderRadius: '50%'},
    {scale: 1.2, borderRadius: '0%'},
    {scale: 1, borderRadius: '25%'}
  ],
  easing: 'easeInOutQuad',
  loop: true
});
```

In this example, the `translateX`, `rotate`, and `backgroundColor` animations occur over the entire duration, while the `scale` and `borderRadius` properties are animated using keyframes.

## Creating Staggered Keyframe Animations

You can create staggered animations using keyframes by combining them with the `stagger` property:

```javascript
anime({
  targets: '.element',
  keyframes: [
    {translateX: 250, opacity: 1},
    {translateY: 50, opacity: 0.5},
    {translateX: 0, opacity: 1}
  ],
  duration: 3000,
  easing: 'easeOutElastic(1, .8)',
  loop: true,
  delay: anime.stagger(200)
});
```

This will apply the keyframe animation to multiple elements with a 200ms delay between each element's animation start time.

## Best Practices and Tips

1. Keep your keyframes simple and focused. If you need complex animations, consider breaking them into multiple anime.js instances.

2. Use the `timeline` feature for more control over sequencing multiple animations.

3. Experiment with different easing functions to achieve the desired animation feel.

4. Use the browser's developer tools to fine-tune your keyframe animations by adjusting timing and property values.

5. When animating CSS transforms, remember that the order of transforms matters. Consider using individual transform properties (e.g., `translateX`, `rotate`) instead of the `transform` property for more predictable results.

By mastering keyframes in anime.js, you can create sophisticated, multi-step animations that bring your web projects to life. Experiment with different combinations of properties, timings, and easing functions to achieve the perfect animation for your needs.
